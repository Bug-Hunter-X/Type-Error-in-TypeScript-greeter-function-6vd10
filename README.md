This repository contains a simple TypeScript program that demonstrates a common type error. The program defines a function called greeter that takes a string argument and returns a string. The program then calls the greeter function with an array of strings as the argument. This causes a type error because the greeter function expects a string argument, but it is receiving an array of strings. The solution is to either modify the greeter function to accept an array of strings or to modify the way the user variable is declared.
